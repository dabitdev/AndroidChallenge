Mobile Android coding challenge

Develop an app that allows a user to see the list of receipts and add the ability to remove them.
Fork this repo and keep it public until the review has been completed.
 
 Android: Java/Kotlin
 Fetch users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
 Receipts should be persisted locally and act on them only local.
 The app has to allow the switch of the user.
 
Evaluation:
 App operates as asked
 No crashes or bugs
 SOLID principles
 Code is understandable and maintainable
 Write at last a test that has coverage in some part that you feel interesting to test.
 If you could use any new architecture like mvvp will be a bonus.
 
Hints:
Let's switch the user by the dropdown view.
To select rows to delete use the gmail UX
/users to fetch the users
/receipts to fetch the albums
